# Vision 2026: NextGen Plaid – Private AI Family Office Tutor

**Target**: Stable prototype Q2 2026, production-ready Q4 2026.

## Core Promise
All family data stays inside a closed system you fully control. Never touches the cloud unless you explicitly allow it (#Hey Grok! escalation only).

## End-State Experience
- You assign an epic or ask a question.
- Agents (SAP, Conductor, CWA) work autonomously using local Ollama 70B/405B.
- Explicit research needs trigger SmartProxy → Grok + tools.
- PRDs, code, reviews, logs appear as clean markdown files in `knowledge_base/`.
- You review/approve/merge only when necessary.
- No browser copy-paste. No Slack. No manual debug loops.

## Key Principles
- Local-first, privacy-hardened.
- Filesystem + Solid Queue for coordination.
- Human in the loop only for approval, security, or overrides.
- All agent prompts external in `knowledge_base/prompts/` – no hardcoding.
- Git-tracked artifacts only.

## Component Roles
- **Explicit Escalation Gateway (SmartProxy)**: Routes #Hey Grok! calls with tools; configurable backends.
- **Senior Advisory Partner (SAP)**: Writes PRDs/epics, performs code reviews.
- **Conductor**: Moves files, enqueues jobs, runs debug proxy.
- **Coder Workflow Agent (CWA)**: Implements approved PRDs → green branches.
- **Debug Proxy**: Whitelisted read-only commands via Conductor.
- **Chief Security Officer**: Privacy guardian (human-led).
- **RAG Layer**: Provides codebase/docs context (embeddings or simple concat).

## Implementation Order
1. SmartProxy
2. Conductor
3. SAP
4. RAG
5. Debug Proxy
6. CWA

## Success Metrics
- Zero unplanned cloud data leakage.
- PRD → working feature in <24 hours (automated).
- You spend <30 min/day on oversight.

This is our north star. All decisions flow from here.

Here is the complete list of vision documents (current as of December 26, 2025):

|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| vision_2026.md                   | Overarching Vision 2026 (north star, timeline, phased implementation order) |
| smart_proxy.md                   | Explicit Escalation Gateway (SmartProxy router and backend config) |
| sap_agent.md                     | Senior Advisory Partner (planner, PRD writer, code reviewer) |
| conductor.md                     | Conductor (traffic director, file mover, job enqueuer) |
| rag.md                           | Knowledge Enrichment / RAG Layer (context provision for agents) |
| debug_proxy.md                   | Debug Proxy (safe whitelisted command execution) |
| chief_security_officer.md        | Chief Security Officer (privacy and compliance guardian) |
| cwa_agent.md                     | Coder Workflow Agent (code implementation from PRDs) |

These are ready to add to `knowledge_base/vision/`. Each has the "Related Epics & Dependencies" section at the bottom as discussed.

Next steps: Add them now? Any final tweaks to titles/content before commit? Or assign next epic to Junie?
