To get production access with the Plaid API, you'll need to follow a few required steps that allow Plaid's team to review your use case and ensure you meet security, compliance, and product requirements.

Steps to Production Access
Sign Up and Integrate in Sandbox
Begin by building and testing your integration in the Plaid Sandbox environment, which uses mock data and is free.
Production Access Request
When you're ready to move to live customer data, request Production access via your Plaid Dashboard.
Provide Company & Use Case Information
During the application, you’ll be asked for:

Details about your company
Details about how you plan to use Plaid and which products you’d like to use
Information required for compliance (see below)
Complete Compliance & Security Requirements

Company and Application Display Info: Enter information about your business and your app. This is especially important for OAuth institutions, as end users see this info during OAuth flows.
Plaid Master Services Agreement (MSA): Sign or review the Plaid MSA.
Security Questionnaire: Complete a questionnaire about your company’s risk and security practices. This helps Plaid ensure safe data access for users.
(Optional for now) Legal Entity Identifier (LEI): For those planning to use OAuth with US banks, you’ll be asked for an LEI, but it is not enforced until April 2026.
Review & Approval
After you submit your production access request and compliance materials, Plaid’s team reviews and may reach out for clarifications or additional details. Approval usually takes a couple of business days.
Production Access Granted
Once approved, you’ll receive production API credentials via the Dashboard, and your application can begin interacting with real user data.
Adding or Modifying Products Later
After gaining production access, you can request additional Plaid products anytime through the Dashboard. You’ll need to provide details about your new use case, and there will be a short review before approval.

If you’re on a Pay-as-you-go or Growth plan, product access is immediate after approval.
If you’re on a Custom plan, an Account Manager will work with you to update your contract before activation.
Additional Notes
OAuth Institutions: Full production access is required before you can connect with OAuth-enabled institutions in the US. You must also complete extra registration steps; see the OAuth institutions page for requirements.
Limited Production: In some cases, you can test with real data before full access is granted—this is called Limited Production. It has caps and may not be available for all products.
